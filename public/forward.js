  // first token of every block (the switch). Helpers that a count needs are started in the background; until they
  // are ready the tokens run on the best count and are not timed.
  // T199: a count's time is the lower median of its 8 (two blocks of 4). What else runs (a collection of the garbage,
  // another tab, the page on its way to the background) slows a block, never speeds one up, so one block slowed whole
  // leaves the other block's 4 below it and the verdict stands. The upper median it was took that block's time: twice
  // in CI 2 threads 1.24 to 1.34 times as fast as 1 lost to it (T190's review).
  // T223: a count is remembered only where a search timed it with nothing of the GPU's getting ready beside it (its
  // upload, its shaders checked against JavaScript and timed use the CPU and the memory: T148 does not time the CPU's
  // prompts then either). A search on the first texts goes on while the GPU gets ready (the first visit is not left on
  // the logical cores meanwhile), but its verdict is used only until the GPU is ready: the first generation after that
  // searches again from it, and that search's verdict is the one remembered. A count remembered from an earlier visit
  // is searched again the same way once a visit (the first generation with no GPU getting ready), not only every
  // recheck generations of one load: the owner's Android kept 4 threads for llm-jp-3 150M where 2 wrote 3.2 times as
  // fast (T223), and a visit seldom writes 8 answers. unchecked: the count in use is not such a search's verdict yet.
  // T239: half may be a dip with a faster count below it. The owner's PC (16 logical cores) stopped at 8 threads ("16 or
  // 8: 8, 8 or 4: 8") where 2 wrote faster, and the search of every later visit began from that 8 and ended on it. So a
