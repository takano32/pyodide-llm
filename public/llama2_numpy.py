    standard re module has not, so they run on the text's character classes (CharClasses) and the pieces are cut
    from the text at the same places (T200: a loop of Python over the characters did it before, a tenth as fast).

    "gpt2" is what ByteLevel(use_regex) applies:
        's|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\p{L}+| ?\p{N}+| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+
    "gpt2-digits" is the same after Digits(individual_digits), which SmolLM2 puts in front of it: every number is a
    piece of its own, \p{N} as Rust's char::is_numeric says (², Ⅱ and ① too, not only \d: T206), and GPT-2's
    pattern runs on each piece as if the piece were the whole text.
    "qwen" is the pattern Qwen2 spells out (the contractions match whatever the case, digits come one by one,
    and a piece of anything-but-a-line-break may lead a word):
        (?i:'s|…)|[^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?\p{L}+|\p{N}| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+[\r\n]*|\s*[\r\n]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+
    "llama3" is Llama 3's, which is Qwen's with the digits taken up to three at a time (\p{N}{1,3}).
    "qwen35" is Qwen3.5's (T229), which is Qwen's with the combining marks (\p{M}) taken into the word they follow:
        (?i:'s|…)|[^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?[\p{L}\p{M}]+|\p{N}| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}]+[\r\n]*|\s*[\r\n]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+
    "minicpm5" is MiniCPM5's (T254), two Splits one after the other: \p{N}{1,3} cuts the numbers off first, up to
    three at a time, and then Llama 3's pattern with \p{N}+ for its numbers runs on each piece as if the piece were
    the whole text. A number piece is one piece either way, so the second stage here is Llama 3's pattern itself. It is
    not Llama 3's on the whole text: before a number, \s+(?!\S) ends at the piece's end and takes all of a run of
    spaces, where Llama 3's leaves the last one of them to stand alone ("a  1": "a", "  ", "1", not "a", " ", " ", "1").
    All six are checked against the real patterns in tests/test_bytebpe.py and tests/test_llama3.py.

        (rotary=0 means all of them) and, when parallel_residual is on, the attention and the FFN both reading
        the same x instead of one after the other.
        arch="qwen35" (T229): Qwen3.5's hybrid attention, see the comment above linear_form(): a Qwen3 of whose layers
        all but every linear["every"]-th are Gated DeltaNet layers with a state in place of keys and values, and whose
        full-attention layers gate their output. linear: the numbers of those layers (FORM's, the file cannot say
        them); rotary and head_dim as below. The state follows the positions: a run begins at position 0, which
        clears it, and goes on one position after the other (forward() refuses any other).
        arch="gpt2": LayerNorm instead of RMSNorm, GELU instead of SwiGLU (and no gate matrix), a learned table
        of positions instead of RoPE, and a bias after every projection. The tensors of the file differ with it,
        so it is llama2_convert.layout(arch=) that says what is there.
        bias=True: the checkpoint ends with a bias for q, k and v of every layer, which is added after those
        projections (Qwen2). The legacy header cannot say so, so the caller does, like the tokenizer settings.
        qk_norm=True (T124): after them come the RMSNorm weights of q and k (one head's size each, per layer), and
        every head of q and k is normalized with them before RoPE (Qwen3). The caller says so, like bias.
        head_dim: the size of a head where it is not dim / n_heads (T124: Qwen3 0.6B has 16 heads of 128 in a dim of
        1024): q and the attention's output are then n_heads * head_dim wide. rms_norm_eps: config.json's, the epsilon
        of every RMSNorm (the kernels take it too).
        rope_scaling: config.json's, for the RoPE tables that are not in the file (int8, float16); see
        rope_frequencies(). ignore_merges: a byte-level BPE takes a pre-tokenized piece that is in the vocabulary
        whole (Llama 3).
        bos starts every sequence; generation ends when the model emits one of stop_tokens.
        kernels is the path of simdkernel.so: the sampling runs on it (penalize, sample). The forward pass on the
        kernels is public/forward.js's (external, below); without external, NumPy computes the forward pass.
        disable: the optimizations to leave out, to measure what each one is worth (T52). Only what already has
        a fallback: "kernels" (NumPy does everything), "int8" (the weights are widened to float32 and the
        float32 kernel multiplies them), "relaxed" (matmul_q8 instead of matmul_q8r), "sampler" (NumPy
