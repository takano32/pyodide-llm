// right, as the engine chooses, T152, and beside it the same with the norms folded or apart), and for each:
//   - every step of it alone (one of its dispatches, the same name counted where two cost the same),
//   - its four matrices alone (the plain matrix × vector over all of a matrix's rows, nothing folded into the write:
//     the "1.77 ms"),
//   - a dispatch of one workgroup that does next to nothing (what a step costs in a chain for being a dispatch),
//   - the whole layer,
// all timed in turn (interleaved(): n of each a submission, 2n less n, the rounds taken of every item alike). The
// layer on the next copy of the weights each time, as layer() times it; a step or a matrix alone on the next range of
// its size of all the copies' weights and the spares (layerParts' ranges(): T202's review, T149's, T208), the
// attention alone on the next of its caches (caches(), T208), so that none is read again before MATVEC_BYTES of others
// (not from the GPU's caches).
// Why each step alone and not the layer less one step: a step of 20 to 60 µs is 1 or 2% of a layer, about what a
// layer's time moves from one pair to the next, so a difference of two layers could not tell it; alone it is repeated
// until a submission takes SUBMISSION_MS. What alone leaves out, the layer less the sum of its steps says: what the
// chain of different dependent dispatches costs beyond each on its own (a small step on a GPU full of the matrix's
// workgroups waits for their tail). Each dispatch still waits for the one before it (the same buffers written), as
// in the layer. The residual stream is written back before every submission (the adds write over it), so that every
// submission starts alike; the whole layer's attention reads the one cache of positions up to LAYER_POS (256 KB of
// keys and values), as in layer(): between two reads of it, a copy's weights (68 MB).
