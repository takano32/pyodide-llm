// six.ts (T98): the 32 values of one int6 group, widened to the int8 the dot products take. kernel/matmul.ts (matmul_q6,
// six_sums) and kernel_relaxed.ts (matmul_q6r) import it. The layout is llama2_numpy.pack6's: an int6 value is an
// int8 with its two low bits zero, so a group widens straight into int8 with no offset. 24 bytes a group: the four
// low bits of the six of value j and of value j + 16 in byte j (0..15), the top two bits of values k, k + 8, k + 16,
// k + 24 in byte 16 + k (0..7) at bits 0, 2, 4, 6. Masks and shifts by constants only: no table.
//
// T166: 8 wasm instructions a group, not 15 (the loads of the tops included). The eight top bytes are read twice over (lanes 0..7 and 8..15 both
// hold byte k) and lanes 0..7 multiplied by 4 as int16 (one mul): then in every lane bits 2-3 hold the top of the
// first half's value (k or k + 8) and bits 6-7 that of the second half's (k + 16 or k + 24), so that each half takes
// its top with one select and no shift per lane. Shifts by 16-bit lanes are used wherever the bits a byte takes from
// its neighbour are masked away (x86 has no 8-bit shifts: V8 makes each of them two instructions).
