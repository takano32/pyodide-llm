// T148 (the review's must-fix 2): the page's default choice of the GPU or the CPU for the blocks of a prompt (not the
// tests' gpuForce.always), on forward.js's real CPU forward pass of llm-jp-3 150M, with a made-up GPU's worker that only
// sleeps for as long as its block would take and answers in the control area (no WebGPU: Node alone). Its times are
// set as multiples of the CPU's own ms a prompt token, measured first, so that the verdicts do not hang on this
// machine's speed. Each generation feeds a prompt as Python does (promptBlock at a time). Checked:
//   - a GPU far faster: the first prompt on the CPU (it is timed first), then every block on the GPU; the eighth
//     generation after the first verdict times the CPU again on the prompt's last 32 tokens only; a short prompt
//     stays on the CPU; another number of threads is timed on the CPU again;
//   - a GPU far slower: every prompt on the CPU, but the eighth after the first verdict, whose first block of 64 goes to
//     the GPU once;
//   - a GPU faster from 36 tokens on (the band of 17 to 64 where the first version of T148 put the prompt on blocks of
//     16 on the GPU in its check, 1.47 times as long): the generation that checks again takes no longer than the others.
// T184 (the review's must-fix): /benchmark/'s page path (forward.js's timePrompts, src/bench.js's pathTable) on the same
// made-up GPU: far faster, every block of the GPU's side on it and a ratio; failing on its sixth block, the GPU's cells
// empty with why and no ratio anywhere (its time was the CPU's: 0.90× before); no GPU, the CPU's side alone.
// T190: the page path's number of threads: a search run to its end (forward.js's endSearch) and timed on the count it
// chose; a count the model page remembers taken with no search.
// T199: the search's verdict on a made-up clock (forward.js's clock), with one block of every comparison slowed 3 times:
// the count that is fastest still chosen (4 of the owner's Android's 8 logical cores, 2 of CI's runner's 4).
// T223: on the same clock, the owner's Android's llm-jp-3 150M (2 threads fastest, 4 a third of 1's speed) chooses 2;
// a search timed while the GPU gets ready is not remembered, and is searched again once the GPU is ready (the times
// beside the GPU say 4, those after it 2: 2 is remembered); a count remembered from an earlier visit is searched again
// on the first generation (not only on the eighth); and the page's key of the count is one a model.
// T240: the GPU ready inside a generation: the search owed begins at that generation's next token and ends in it.
// T239: the owner's PC's times (8 remembered, 4 no faster, 2 fastest): 2, by the quarter the search compares after half.
// T152: the steps of a generation (forward.js's tokenBlock and generateMany, tokenTimes) on the same made-up GPU, whose
// step sleeps a multiple of the CPU's own ms of a token and writes made-up ids: generations of STEPS steps after a short
// prompt, as Python takes them (tokenBlock at a time on the GPU, else one on the CPU). Far faster: the first steps on the
// CPU (timed first), then every one on the GPU, and the eighth generation after the first verdict its first 4 on the
// CPU; far slower: every step on the CPU but that generation's first run; failing on its second request: the CPU from
// there on, the step it gave back taken by the CPU. And Python's generate() through external(), as the page's worker
// runs it, on the far faster one: sampled and greedy, the steps on the GPU and the counts right (the made-up GPU fails a
// request whose random numbers, history or settings are not what Python should hand over); and through Python on one
// that fails on its second request: the generation goes on whole on the CPU (T152's review: JavaScript's null is jsnull).
// T219: a GPU that samples -1 (SAMPLE's NONE) or an id past the vocabulary: that request refused whole, the CPU from
// there on, and the status line says why; a model on the GPU alone stops with words and is not loaded again.
// T205: release() waits for the GPU's worker to say "ended" (a slow one; one that never does, terminated after 5 s; one
// stopped while it got ready), and so does Llama.release() called from JavaScript through Python, as the page's worker
// calls it (the review); a browser that does not say the device's memory keeps the steps on the CPU.
