# fixed_outputs.py
# Real models against the text they wrote when a person read it and found it sound (T86). Twice last week every
# test passed while the page wrote broken text (T72: v permuted as well, rotary never passed on), because the
# synthetic models of the unit tests cannot tell a sensible sentence from a wrong one. These can.
#
# One small model per architecture and source, converted the way the page converts it (llama2_convert.Conversion,
# fed the file in order) to float32, then 16 greedy tokens from the model's own prompt and template. float32
# because int8 changes its text with the order of additions (AGENTS.md); float32 with NumPy is the same, to the
# character, as float32 with the kernels. Where each model comes from, its prompt and template are read from
# src/models.js (with Node), so nothing here can drift from the list.
#
#   python3 tests/fixed_outputs.py <directory for the downloads> [--write] [--only=<id>,<id>]
#
# --write records what the models write now, into tests/fixtures/fixed-outputs.json: do that only after reading it.
# --only runs those models alone (a broken converter tried on the one model it should break, T204).

# one per architecture and way in: GPT-NeoX, GPT-2, a Llama from a GGUF (T74), a Llama with a Unigram tokenizer.json,
# and a Qwen3 (T124: the norms of q and k, heads of 128 in a dim of 1024), from its GGUF and from its safetensors
# (T212). Pythia and GPT-2 come from GGUFs since
# T136's third stage, so a GPT-2 from a safetensors file too (T204): rinna's, whose names begin with "transformer.",
# whose Conv1D matrices the plan transposes as they come, and whose sentencepiece model normalizes as nmt_nfkc.
# The list takes Qwen3 from a GGUF since T203, so its safetensors, the way ?hf= opens a Qwen3 (the norms of q and k and
# the size of the heads read from config.json and the tensors' names), gets a fixed output of its own too (T212): the
# same entry with the weights of the original repository its vocabulary comes from, named as the page's hfEntry()
# names them. T235: Ternary-Bonsai 1.7B, the one model of PQ2_0 blocks and of yarn's RoPE (its angles and the longer
# cos and sin), and the one whose template comes from chat_template.jinja. Its float32 checkpoint is 6.9 GB.
# T229 and T236: a Qwen3.5 (hybrid attention: Gated DeltaNet layers between full-attention ones), the 0.8B, the same
# two ways: from the list's GGUF (llama.cpp's names for the linear-attention layers, the norms that come with their 1,
# -exp(A_log), the two small matrices of the gates as Q8_0 rounds them) and from the safetensors of the original (the
# revision tests/reference_qwen35.py holds the engine to transformers on, whose weights are one file under a shard's
# name). The format is the list's: the model's own calls a macro, which the converter does not read.
# T253: Granite 4.2 3B, the smallest of the models whose q the converter scales (a Granite's attention multiplies its
# scores by config.json's attention_multiplier), from the list's GGUF, where the multiplier is metadata and q is turned
# as a Llama's. Its float32 checkpoint is 14.6 GB. T254: MiniCPM5 1B, the model of the two-stage pre-tokenizer and the
# first Llama from a GGUF whose heads are not dim / heads (128 in 1536).
