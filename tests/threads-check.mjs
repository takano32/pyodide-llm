// T93 stage 2: the forward pass of forward.js with helper threads on a shared memory. The forward pass runs in a
// worker, as on the page (the model's worker coordinates); run from the main thread next to Pyodide it waited on
// its helpers several times longer. Python in the main thread only makes the plan.
//   1. Every row is computed whole by one thread with the same kernel, so the logits of a greedy run must be the
//      same to the bit with any number of threads.
//   2. The speeds, the counts in turn, several rounds, the median.
//   3. The search (stage 2b): which count it chooses from navigator.hardwareConcurrency, within a few generations,
//      against the fastest of 2.
//   4. T108: the same text as a prompt in blocks (forwardMany): the last logits the same to the bit with every
//      count, and what a token of a prompt costs in blocks of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16, with each count.
//
//   node tests/threads-check.mjs [model id ...] [--threads 1,2,4,8] [--rounds 5] [--positions 64] [--kv-start 16]
//        [--from 0] [--without kv16] [--versus-half]
//
// --from: the speeds of step 2 are measured from this position on, the KV cache filled up to it first (T109: the
// attention of a long context).
//
// --without: the optimizations to leave out (the engine's disable, T52), e.g. kv16 for a float32 cache (T160).
//
// --versus-half (T160): the speeds of step 2 again, the keys and values as chosen (float32 for a grouped-query model,
// keysInHalf) and in float16 (what every int8 model on a shared memory had before), engine and engine in turn in
// this process: the one difference between this branch and main.
//
// --kv-start: the KV cache starts this small (the page's KV_START is 256), so that it has to grow, and move, under
// the helper threads within the positions of a run (Fable's review of T93).
