// The forward pass of public/forward.js (the page's) against the NumPy forward of llama2_numpy.py, on the models of
// this directory (make models kernels) or converted ones. Since T93 there is no other forward to hold it to.
//   float32: the kernels add in another order than NumPy, so the last bits differ; the most likely token must be the
//            same at every position, and no logit may differ by more than 1e-3 (measured 2026-09-25: 1.7e-5 to 3.7e-5).
//   int8: forward.js quantizes the activations too (7 bits with relaxed SIMD), NumPy does not, so the numbers
//         differ by design. Measured 2026-09-25 on NumPy's greedy text: at 128 positions the most likely token the
//         same at 93.8 to 100% and the perplexity -0.23 to +2.00% apart; at 64 positions llm-jp-3 150M was 87.5% and
//         +3.42% (fewer positions, more spread). The line: 85% or more and within 5%, at 128 positions (the
//         default). A real fault (a wrong order, a wrong scale) lands far outside: the agreement near nothing and
//         the perplexity a multiple.
// T108: the same text read by forward.js one token at a time and in blocks (forward_many), from a KV cache that
// starts small so that it grows within the blocks: the last logits must be the same to the bit.
// T130: forward.js's KV cache starts at 16 positions against NumPy, so that it grows in place (16 -> 32 -> 64 -> 128)
// within the positions compared: a block moved to the wrong place, or written over before it moved, is read back.
// Then the speeds, both in turn. Runs in the deployment.
