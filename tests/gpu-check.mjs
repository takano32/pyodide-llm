// T135: the prompt on the GPU (public/gpu.js) against the CPU's (public/forward.js) and NumPy's (llama2_numpy.py), in
// a real browser, as WebGPU is nowhere else: Playwright's Chromium, whose WebGPU without a GPU is SwiftShader (the CPU
// in the GPU's place: its speed means nothing, its numbers are right or not).
//
//   node tests/gpu-check.mjs [model id | synthetic | made-up ...] [--engine chromium|chrome|msedge] [--forms <part,part>]
//   node tests/gpu-check.mjs ... --engine dawn --webgpu <the npm package webgpu's directory>
//
// T147: --engine dawn runs the same in Node on Dawn (the npm package webgpu, not a dependency of this project: install
// it under .tmp/) with the Vulkan of the machine, Mesa's lavapipe on the development machine: shader-f16 and subgroups,
// which SwiftShader lacks (AGENTS.md). The harness and the GPU's worker are then worker threads.
//
// Node reads each model with Pyodide as the page does and records two things: the plan that forward.js gets from
// Python (where every tensor is), and NumPy's answer for a prompt of 150 tokens: the keys and values of every layer at
// every position the prompt's blocks fill, and the logits of its last token. NumPy multiplies the int8 weights
// widened to float32 by float32 activations, which is what the GPU does; forward.js on the CPU quantizes the
// activations as well (7 bits with relaxed SIMD), so it is farther from both by design. The browser then runs
// forward.js in a worker (it waits in Atomics.wait, which a page may not) on the same memory: the prompt through
// forwardMany() and its last token through forward(), once on the CPU and with the GPU's worker once for the shaders
// it chooses and once for every tiled shader of the matrices (T147), the prompt in blocks of 16 and then all at once.
// The cache starts at 8 positions, so that both grow within the prompt (8 to 256). Checked:
//   - the GPU took every token of the prompt (gpuTokens), the same again from position 0, and a block that begins
//     past the keys and values it holds went to the CPU;
//   - the keys and values it wrote back into the cache, against NumPy's: the worst row (a layer's keys or values of
//     one position) no more than the line of the shader's arithmetic (GPU_LINE and the next, see there);
//   - T147: a request forward.js gave up on (a GPU that answers late) writes nothing (the made-up model only);
//   - T187: the scale of the first layer's keys and values against NumPy's (SCALE_LINE, see there);
//   - the logits of the prompt's last token (the CPU's in both runs, on the GPU's keys and values in one): NumPy's
//     most likely token or a near tie (their KL divergence from NumPy's is printed, not held to a line: see there).
// "synthetic": a made-up int8 model with grouped-query attention (4 heads, 2 of keys and values; none of the models
// of this directory has it). T153: "synthetic-qwen2", the same with biases of q, k and v (Qwen2's; T187: drawn around
// 0, 0.3·N, as GPT-2's below) and an epsilon of 1e-6; "synthetic-qwen3", the norms of every head of q and k (Qwen3's), heads of 32 where dim / heads is 16 (q and
// the attention's output 128 wide, dim 64), and an epsilon of 0.5, near mean(x²) (T150: an epsilon far below it
// hides a wrong one); both of three layers. T154: "synthetic-gpt2", GPT-2's form (LayerNorm with biases, a bias after
// every matrix, an FFN of two matrices and GELU, learned positions and no RoPE), and "synthetic-neox", GPT-NeoX's (the
// same with RoPE on the first quarter of every head, as Pythia's rotary_pct 0.25, and the parallel residual), both of
// three layers and 4 heads of keys and values (neither has grouped-query attention), their biases drawn around 0 (the
// review of T154: a bias of 1 ± 0.03 is nearly the same number everywhere, and LayerNorm's mean takes most of it out);
// "synthetic-neox-256", GPT-NeoX with Pythia 1B's heads of 256 (dim 512, 2 heads), 64 of them turned. T155:
// "synthetic-6bit", int6 weights (T98's, which the GPU widens to int8 as it takes them: the shader is shaders.js's
// WIDEN_SIX), and "synthetic-wide", int8 in a 64-bit memory with the checkpoint 4 GiB up (T101: every address past
// 2^32; the pages below are never touched), both of dim 128 and hidden 320 with the GPU's matrices in pieces of
// 20480 bytes at most (gpuForce.pieceBytes: w1 and w3 in three, w2 in two, the last of w1's rows short), as a matrix
// past a buffer of the device goes. The others are the models of this directory (make models kernels), or <prefix>.json: a
// model tests/perplexity_prepare.py converted (<prefix>.bin, <prefix>.tokenizer.bin, and the options in <prefix>.json;
// gpu-prompt.yml's input real= fetches and converts models of src/models.js so, T183), whose NumPy answer comes from
// the native Python ($PYTHON, python3 by default).
//
// T152: a generation's steps on the GPU (forward.js's generateMany, gpu.js's fused layer of a token and SAMPLE), after
// the prompt of a run whose GPU took them (the first, and one a form of a token's layer this adapter can make: each
// forced): NumPy continues the prompt greedy for GEN tokens (its logits of each step, and the keys and values of their
// positions); the GPU is asked for 4 steps greedy from the prompt's last token, the CPU then takes one step (the
// forward pass on the keys and values the GPU wrote back), and the GPU 3 more (the CPU's position goes up to it first).
// Checked: the ids are NumPy's, or where one is not, a near tie (T187's: NumPy gives it at least half the probability
// of its most likely; the steps after it are not compared, their inputs differ; the CPU's step feeds NumPy's id to the
// GPU's next ones whatever it chose); the keys and values the GPU wrote back of its first 4 positions in forward.js's
// cache against NumPy's, a layer at a time (T187), to the line of the prompt's shaders of the same arithmetic (float32 GPU_LINE or K × E16;
// DP4A K_PACKED × Q8's distance) or the run's own prompt's distance, the larger (the steps' attention reads the
// prompt's keys and values; the next 3 read the CPU's step's too, its 7-bit activations, and are held to their ids); a
// stop token (NumPy's second) ends the steps after it; a penalty of 100 on NumPy's first id (greedy) gives the largest
// of NumPy's logits penalized so (or a near tie); two sampled steps at temperature 2 with random numbers of 0.02 and
// 0.98 give two tokens of NumPy's nucleus, not the same (the random numbers reach the GPU: where either lands is not
// held to NumPy's, the GPU's logits being others; the draw itself is SAMPLE's, checked on the device, gpu.js); and a
// step after the prompt went through the CPU while the GPU's own cache held the keys and values of other tokens
// (a prompt of them through the GPU first): the CPU's most likely token on its own keys and values, or a near tie of
// its logits (the CPU's keys and values went up). T226: the made-up Qwen2 and Qwen3 too (their biases of q, k and v
// drawn around 0, an epsilon of 0.5 on the norms of heads of 32 where dim / heads is 16: what a step's ADD, HEAD_NORM
// and TOKEN_ROPE must get right in every layer, held by the keys and values a layer at a time), and the made-up GPT-2
// and GPT-NeoX (LayerNorm, the biases, GELU, the positions added to a step's embedding, RoPE on a part of a head, the
// parallel residual); the made-up GPT-2's final norm has eight weights of 12 (GPT-2's outlier channels, T92: the
// engine takes their columns of the classifier apart on the CPU, and the GPU's classifier multiplies floats).
//
// T183: what a person reads to judge it, in the log of CI (the development machine does not run WebGPU's tests): E16,
// how far NumPy's answer moves when nothing but its cache is rounded to float16 (answer(half=True), T153's review), and
// for each model a table of the keys and values by layer, a column E16 and one a run (the CPU's, and the GPU's lettered
// A, B...) against NumPy's, another against NumPy's with its cache in float16, a line a run with its form, its line and
// the ratio to it, how many E16 it is and its most likely token, and the seconds of every step. T187: Q8 (NumPy's
// with the inputs of the layers' matrices in 8 bits as well) beside E16 and a table against it, the first layer's
// scale, the logits' KL divergence and the difference of the ten most likely (in place of the logits' ratio to the
// CPU's).

//   float32 (TF.js's tiles, llama.cpp's f32): 8.1e-4 to 2.4e-3 for the models here, 3.90e-3 for the made-up one: the

//   - the packed shaders (8-bit activations) to Q8: NumPy's answer with the inputs of the layers' matrices quantized
//     as quantize_x does it (8 bits, 32 a group, half to even) and its cache in float16, which is ORT's DP4A's
//     arithmetic. Their first layer against Q8's: 8.1e-5 to 2.9e-3 (Qwen3 0.6B the most), the line GPU_LINE (a
//     LayerNorm's mean over n − 1: 1.57e-2 and 1.93e-2). Past the first layer the 8-bit roundings that fall on the
//     other side of a boundary part them from Q8 as far as Q8 is from NumPy's (a GPU as it should be 0.25 to 2.6 Q8
//     from Q8), so all their layers are held against NumPy's: 0.49 to 1.40 times Q8's distance from it (GPT-2 124M

//     tables' two digits (Qwen2.5 0.5B's layer 17, Qwen3 0.6B's layer 27), so K_PACKED is 3; the runs read 1.44 at
//     most (0.48 of the line, SmolLM2 360M's layer 13, run 36325960845; 1.17 on subgroups of 16, run 36325111922), the
//     made-up models 1.02. A bias read from
//     layer 0 in every layer went under a line of 2 on the made-up Qwen2 while its biases were near 1 in every layer
//     (0.98), and goes past its layer's line 2.34 times (7.02 Q8 over all layers) with biases drawn around 0 (0.3·N; a
//     correct one 1.01 Q8, 0.34 of its lines), and 2534 times on Qwen2.5 0.5B (run 36325111772).
//   - the scale of the first layer's keys and values (the norm's scale wrong by a little, as a mean of squares or a
//     variance over n − 1 (1 + 1/2n: 7.8e-3 at dim 64, 5.2e-4 at 960) or a wrong epsilon, stays under the rows' lines,
//     and the fused norm's quantized integers do not see it at all, T175): the least-squares factor s of the GPU's
//     against NumPy's (the packed shaders' against Q8's, whose own scale moves by up to 4.4e-4), sum(g·w) / sum(w·w),
//     which the rounding of single values leaves at 1 within its noise over thousands of values. |s − 1|: 3.8e-9 to
//     3.3e-5 as it should be; RMSNorm over n − 1 5.2e-4 to 1.0e-2, LayerNorm's variance over n − 1 5.4e-4 to 7.4e-3.
//     The line SCALE_LINE: n − 1 goes past it up to a dim of 5000. Only where f32 rounds to f16 to the nearest, as
//     SwiftShader and lavapipe do (the review, 2026-09-27): WGSL (15.7.6) leaves the direction open, and a GPU that
//     rounds toward zero shrinks every value, which does not average out. A throwaway branch that truncates the
//     cache's pack2x16float and the f16 tiles' operands (run 36320147208) read s − 1 = −3.4e-4 to −3.9e-4 on the
//     float32 and packed shaders and −9.5e-4 to −1.1e-3 on the f16 ones, every model, with every other line held: on
//     such a GPU this line fails a GPU as it should be (then hold the scale against NumPy's rounded toward zero too,
//     and the f16 shaders to about 2e-3).
//   - the logits of the prompt's last token (on the CPU in every run, on the GPU's keys and values in the GPU's): the
//     most likely token NumPy's, or one NumPy gives at least half the probability of its most likely (a near tie:
//     T147's stories15M at 149 tokens). Their KL divergence from NumPy's is printed and held to no line (the review,
//     2026-09-27): the CPU computes that last token with its 7-bit activations, so the KL is the CPU's arithmetic,
//     not the GPU's. The CPU alone is 9.1e-5 to 9.8e-2 on the made-up models (synthetic-6bit the most), and on keys and
//     values that are 1.0 E16 (TF.js) synthetic-wide read 0.22 to 0.27 on every job of run 36320963317, where a line
//     of 0.05 failed it. A wrong bias on Qwen2.5 0.5B reads 9.3 to 11.7, and fails the keys and values' lines 1569
//     times over and the most likely token as well. Printed beside it: the largest difference of the logits of
//     NumPy's ten most likely tokens over NumPy's largest |logit| (the old measure took all of them: GPT-2's went past
//     on a token some 50 logits below the top).
