 * and "tokens on the GPU"); gpu: { fallback, lost }. T191: each row also the ms a token with the sampling in chunks
 * (shaders.js's SAMPLER_STAGES, many workgroups) where the rest is SAMPLE's one workgroup. A row a way of submitting: one token a submission, each read back as it comes, and
 * several in one submission, read back once. "A submission besides its tokens" (F) is what a submission costs past its
 * tokens' work (the wait and the reading back: a row's ms a token times its tokens, less a token's work, the
 * difference of 2n tokens in one submission and n), "of it a token" F over the row's tokens (what is left of F a
 * token), and "faster than one a submission" the first row's ms a token
 * over the row's: neither where noRatios() says none, where the check found the sampling or the run WRONG, nor
 * (the first) where a token's work was unsteady. A submission's cost below 0 (a token's work read higher than the
